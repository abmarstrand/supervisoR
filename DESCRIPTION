Description: Package enabling visualization of hierarchical pathways across many conditions.
  Currently working with REACTOME pathways, enabling exploratory data analyses of a given parent pathway and all of it's children.
  Works for an arbitrary number of groups (tested with n=20) and with arbitrary input data, though we reccommend using directional enrichment scores.
  Contains both a shiny app for exploration and commands for the generation of hierarchical plots
