\usage{
generate_relation_legend(
  relations_present,
  relation_colors = c(is_a = "black", part_of = "blue", regulates = "green",
    positively_regulates = "orange", negatively_regulates = "red"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{relations_present}{A character vector of relations that are present in the current dataset (excluding NA).}

\item{relation_colors}{A named character vector mapping each relation to a color.}

\item{relation_linetypes}{A named character vector mapping each relation to a valid ggplot2 linetype
(e.g., "solid", "dashed", "dotted", "dotdash", "longdash").}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the relation legend. Each relation is shown with its corresponding line style and color.
}
\description{
Creates a standalone legend plot depicting the line types and colors associated
with different pathway relations. This plot can be combined with the enrichment
legend plot using \code{cowplot::plot_grid()} to display a unified legend.
