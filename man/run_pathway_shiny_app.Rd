\arguments{
\item{enrichment_scores}{A data.frame with pathways as rows and conditions as columns,
containing enrichment scores. Pathways should correspond to the labels in the pathway graph.}

\item{conditions}{A character vector specifying the conditions to visualize. These should match
the column names in enrichment_scores.}

\item{mapping}{A data.frame containing mapping information between pathways and their
exactSource IDs. This is typically obtained from the load_default_data or
load_and_preprocess_gene_sets functions.}

\item{exactSource_to_name}{A named vector mapping exactSource IDs to pathway names. This
facilitates the translation between graph node identifiers and human-readable names.}

\item{g}{An igraph object representing the pathway graph. Nodes should have a
label attribute corresponding to pathway names.}

\item{gene_sets}{A named list where each element corresponds to a pathway and contains
the associated genes. Names should match the pathway labels in the graph.}

\item{enrichment_limits}{Optional numeric vector of length two specifying the minimum and
maximum enrichment scores for visualization. If NULL, limits are computed from
enrichment_scores.}

\item{glyph_size}{Optional numeric vector specifying the width and height of glyphs in
pixels. Default is c(80, 60).}

\item{res}{Optional numeric value specifying the resolution of glyph images in DPI.
Default is 96.}

\item{cache_dir}{Optional character string specifying the directory to store cached glyphs.
Default is "glyph_cache".}

\item{layout_options_plot}{Optional list specifying layout options for ggraph.
Default is list(layout = "fr", type = "full", physics = FALSE).}

\value{
Launches a Shiny application for interactive pathway visualization.
}
\description{
This function launches a Shiny application for visualizing pathway enrichment scores
and their relationships within a pathway graph. Users can interactively explore
top-level pathways and their sub-pathways, view glyphs representing enrichment scores
across multiple conditions, and reset the view to the initial state.
